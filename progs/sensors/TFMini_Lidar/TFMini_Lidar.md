[Collaboration](#collaboration)## General Info***TFMini*** is a **MBED OS** library developed for the **TF Mini Lidar** module from *Benewake*. ![](https://www.gotronic.fr/ori-capteur-de-distance-lidar-tf-mini-s-31337.jpg)This module is a Time-Of-Flight distance sensor. Distance is from 0.1 to 12 meters.This directory contains :- *TFMini.h* / *TFMini.cpp* files : library files to include in your MBED OS project- *main_TFMini.cpp* file : an example of using this Library- *TFMini.bin* file : a precompiled file for *STMicroelectronics* Nucleo L476RG board (A4, A5 for serial communication port)- *images* directory : images used for this tutorial## RessourcesTo obtain more informations about the TFMini Lidar module from Benewake, you can check the [Benewake Datasheet](https://www.gotronic.fr/pj2-sj-gu-tfmini-s-01-a00-datasheet-2154.pdf) or the [Benewake Product Manual](https://www.gotronic.fr/pj2-sj-gu-tfmini-s-01-a00-datasheet-2154.pdf) (from GoTronic page).For beginners who starts programming with **Keil Studio** or **MBED Studio** on embedded STM32 targets, check this **series of tutorials** about [Nucleo board / Step by step programming](http://lense.institutoptique.fr/nucleo/)## InstallationTo use this library, you have to copy *TFMini.h* / *TFMini.cpp* files into the *libs* directory of your **MBED Studio** or **Keil Studio** project.Then you have to include the header file (*TFMini.h*) into your main code with the command :```c#include "TFMini.h"```## How To Use`## CollaborationThis library was written by **Julien Villemejane** @jvillemejane for embedded programs on *STMicroelectronics* Nucleo L476RG board.  This library is a traduction of the Arduino Library for the [TFMini](https://github.com/opensensinglab/tfmini/tree/master) The last modification : **Julien Villemejane** - 02/feb/2024
